# Examples of Optimization for Matrix Multiplication
In these files there are some examples of code optimization for classical matrix multiplication.
You can refer to [https://www.zagonico.com/c-code-optimization-matrix-multiplication/](https://www.zagonico.com/c-code-optimization-matrix-multiplication/)
for furher information.

# Usage
I have still to clean the sources and scripts, so they are not "ready to use", maybe you'll have to change something
to make them work. I redirect you to the blog and the program help for details on implementation and usage mode.

In C files there are functions with the various features implemented (described in the blog) and
script prof.sh and prof2.sh just launch the programs created from the C files more times to make an
average execution time.

C sources automatically create a random matrix for the computation you just need to specify the size with the
program parameters.
